How to run application?? Or how to start server? 
Go to the StdApp.. 
nom start or 
webpack-dev-server --development --open

Ok now how we can write the employee in mongodb?? 
Router().post("/", (req, res, next) => {
       
}) 

What is user request?? req?? 
How many ways we can send data to server?? 
Using req.body, 
Using req.headers
Uisng req.query
Using req.params
Now I have the data.. What is the next thing?? 
My data is in the object format or whatever it is.. 

Now if we have the data what is the next thing to do?? 
We have to put this data within the mongodb or not.. 
How is the structure of mongodb??
We have the mongo server.. Within that we have the mongodb database.. 
Within this we have the collection. Within this we have the documents.. 
My document type is what?? It is always an object or not.. 

Whatever my client is going to pass but we are going to send as object to my mongodb. . 
So that we will ask client only to pass the data in the form of object?? 

Ok.. I have the data now.. What's next... 
Received the request.. Got the data... 
Nect is establishing connection with database or not... 
Ok how we can?? 

What is my data base?? mongodb.. Inside server folder.. 
We have to install that first.. How we can?? 
   npm install mongodb  --save

Once it is installed can we get that one?? 
How we can get?? 
   var mongo = require("mongodb");

//get the MongoClient.. How we can? 
   var mongoclient = mongo.MongoClient;

Now we have to connect with this particular database or not.. 
i.e. mongodb.. 
First we have to connect to the server.. From there We have to go to database... 
From there we have to operate on this collection.. 

Ok... Now first check if my mongodb is running on my local machine or on cloud.. 

If it is a cloud.. Last day we saw.. We have to take that particular url.. Cloud url.. 
If it is a local database then that time.. We will be using like 
  mongodb://localhost:27017/mongodb

We have to connect with this particular url.. Ok how we can connect to this??
we will use mongoclient.connect()..which takes 2arguments .. One is the mongodb url.. And second is the call back function or not.. 
Here I tried to make connection with mongodb.. It may be success or failure.. 
So in the callback function always my first argument is like error.. And here we have to send the error back.. 
Nd second argument is db object in case of success.. 
If it is a success then what we need to do?? 


   var mongo = require("mongodb");
   var mongoclient = mongo.MongoClient;
   mongoclient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mongodb", (


*******************************************************

How can we create our custom bind method as mybind() which works exactly smae as javascript bind()?? 
Suppose I have a function f() with 2 arguments.. 
And we have an object called o.. 
How many ways we can call bind() on object o? 

f.bind(o)(10,20);
f.bind(o,10)(20);
f.bind(o,10,20)();

Now if we have to replace this predefined bind() method with our custom mybind() method.. Which works exactly the same as the bind() method..
Now how can we create the own bind() method??
