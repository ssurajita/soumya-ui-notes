What is an abstract class?
  //An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods. 
  Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. 
  An abstract class may have static fields and static methods. 
  When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. 
  However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.
