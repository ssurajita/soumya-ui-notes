What do you understand by a css selector?
  // A CSS selector is a pattern to match the elements in an HTML document.
  
What are the different types of simple selector available in CSS?
  //type e.g. div
  //class e.g. .classname
  //id e.g. #idname
  //universal e.g. *
  //attribute e.g. [attr] [attr=value] [attr~=value] [attr|=value] [attr^=value] [attr$=value] [attr*=value]
  
What are the combinators selectors available in CSS?
  //A + B => Adjacent Sibling Selector
             B should be just next immediate sibling of A, so there should not be any intermediate elements between A and sibling B
             e.g. div + p 
             <div>parent div
                <div>my div</div>
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered
             </div>
  //A ~ B => General sibling selector
             All B's should be sibling of A, but there might be some intermediate elements between A and sibling B's. 
             e.g. div ~ p 
             <div>parent div
                <div>my div</div>
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered
                <input />
                <span>
                  <p>my first div</p> -- not considered
                </span>
                <p>my first div</p>   -- considered
             </div>
  //A > B => child
             B should be immediate child of A, there might be multiple intermediate diff childs, but all immediate childs should be considered.
             e.g. div > p 
             <div>parent div
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered
                <span> <p>my first div</p> </span>  -- not considered
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered
             </div>
  //A B  => Descendant
             B should be child of A at any level inside 
             e.g. div p 
             <div>parent div
                <div>my div</div>
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered
                <span>
                  <p>second p</p>    -- considered
                </span>
             </div>
             
  //A || B => Column Combinators
