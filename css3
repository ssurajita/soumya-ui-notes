What are the different versions of CSS?
  //CSS1, CSS2, CSS2.1, CSS3, CSS4
  
How many ways we can include css to a file?
  //linked, imported, embedded, in-line
  <link href="css_file.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
  @import url("another_stylesheet.css") media-types;
  <style> style rules <style>
  <tagname style="style rules" >

  inline has more priorty than embed css and embed css has more priority than external css.
  
What is the syntax for link in css for external css files?
  <link href="cssfile.css" rel="stylesheet type="text/css" media="all">
  
What is the syntax for script in html5?
  <script src="file.js" type="text/javascript" />

What is CSS precedence? What is CSS specificity?
  If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, 
    the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out.
  //1. inline css ( html style attribute ) overrides css rules in style tag and css file
    2. a more specific selector takes precedence over a less specific one
    3. rules that appear later in the code override earlier rules if both have the same specificity.
    4. A css rule with !important always takes precedence.
    5. The universal selector (*) has low specificity, while ID selectors are highly specific! 

What is css position property?
  //The position property can help you manipulate the location of an element or origin of the element.
  By default the origin for each elements is its top left corner. 
  possible values are - static, absolute, relative ,fixed, sticky, inherit
  default positioning value - static
  
  static   - static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. 
             A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned. 
  
  relative - The element is positioned relative to its normal position or from origin. 
             Now changing the position to relative on an element simply does not do anything.
             However it enables 4 different properties to work on it - top, left, bottom, right
             
  absolute - Most used one
             Changing the element to absolute is actually disrupts entire environment. Every elements moves up.
             This type of positioning allows you to place your element precisely where you want it.
             The positioning is done relative to the first relatively (or absolutely) positioned parent element. 
             In the case when there is no positioned parent element, it will be positioned related directly to the HTML element (the page itself).
             parent -> relative , child -> absolute , to make these 4 different properties to work on it - top, left, bottom, right
             
             absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport
            
   fixed   - A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

What is css display property and what are its values?
  //The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
  Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. 
  The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
  
  possible values are - block, inline, inline-block , none, flex

What is block elements?
  //A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 
                        (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    e.g. div, p , h1- h6, form, header, footer, section 
    
What is inline elements?
  //An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
  e.g. span, a , img
  
What is inline-block elements?

Difference between inline, block and inline-block?
  //display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element unlike display: inline
    display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element unlike display : block, 
                                so the element can sit next to other elements.
  
How to center align block level elements e.g. div or paragraphs?

How to center align a text in an element?
  //text-align : center
  
What is the difference between display : none vs visibility : hidden ?

How to keep multiple divs in a single line side by side?
  //Use float : left for all the divs you want to keep side by side , then use clear : left for the div you wish to add it to new line
  //Use display : inline-block for all the divs you want to keep side by side, then for div you wish to add it to new line dont add any property

What do you understand by a css selector?
  // A CSS selector is a pattern to match the elements in an HTML document.

  //type e.g. div
  //class e.g. .classname
  //id e.g. #idname
  //universal e.g. *
  //attribute e.g. [attr] [attr=value] [attr~=value] [attr|=value] [attr^=value] [attr$=value] [attr*=value]
  
What are the combinators selectors available in CSS?
  //A + B => Adjacent Sibling Selector
             B should be just next immediate sibling of A, so there should not be any intermediate elements between A and sibling B
             e.g. div + p 
             <div>parent div
                <div>my div</div>
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered
             </div>
  //A ~ B => General sibling selector
             All B's should be sibling of A, but there might be some intermediate elements between A and sibling B's. 
             e.g. div ~ p 
             <div>parent div
                <div>my div</div>
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered

                <p>my first div</p>   -- considered
             </div>
  //A > B => child
             B should be immediate child of A, there might be multiple intermediate diff childs, but all immediate childs should be considered.
             e.g. div > p 
             <div>parent div
                <p>my first div</p>  -- considered

             </div>
  //A B  => Descendant
             B should be child of A at any level inside

                  value has to be a whole word. (-) allowed e.g. value-top
  //[attr^=value] The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value begins with a specified value. 
                  value does not have to be a whole word! e.g. value, value-top, valuetop
  //[attr$=value] The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value. 
                  value does not have to be a whole word! e.g. value, bottom-value, bottomvalue

   syntax is - selector:pseudo-class {}
   
What do you understand by pseudo elements?
  //A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
    e.g. Style the first letter, or line, of an element, Insert content before, or after, the content of an element.
    e.g. ::first-line, ::first-letter, ::after, ::before, ::selection
    
What is the difference between pseudo classes and pseudo elements?
  //Pseudo classes are for selecting elements that exist but you can't select with the DOM. 
  There's no way to tell what div being hovered in the markup, it depends on the action of the user. 
  The div exists, but there's no way to select it with a normal class. 
  Pseudo classes can be chained and used like a regular classes. 
  
  A pseudo element selects elements that don't exist, creating a new virtual element. 
  For instance, there's no tags for the first-line of an element. 
  So it's like ::first-line is creating virtual tags to make it select-able. 
  You can only use one pseudo element per selector, unlike Pseudo classes. 
  
What is the difference between nth-child(n) vs nth-of-type(n)?

    1 cm = 10 mm
    1 px = 1/96 inch
    1 pt = 1/72 inch
    1 pc = 12pt = 1/6 inch  

   e.g. relative Lengths - vw, vh, vmin, vmax, %, em, ex, ch, rem

      2. Use responsive text size - vw unit e.g. font-size:10vw
      3. Responsive Images(set width to 100% for proper scaleup) - style="width:100%;"
      4. Media Queries - 
                 @media screen and (max-width: 800px) { }
      5. Bootstrap

  //column-width - The column-width property specifies the width for the columns. e.g. column-width : 100px;
  //columns - shorthand for column-width and column-count e.g. columns: 30px 4;
  //column-rule-width - The column-rule-width property sets the width of the rule between columns.e.g. column-width: 10px;
  //column-rule-style - The column-rule-style property sets the style of the rule between columns.e.g. column-style: solid;
  //column-rule-color - The column-rule-color property sets the color of the rule between columns.e.g. column-color: red;
  //column-rule - The column-rule property sets the width, style, and color of the rule between columns.e.g. column-rule: 4px double red;
  //column-span - The column-span property specifies how many columns an element should span across. values : none(default), all
                  Suppose we have a div whicha has one h2 header following few contents.
                  And we are applying column layout on div , but do not wish the h2 to be part of column layout, 
                  it should look like a header to the columns. We can specify e.g. h2{ column-span : all }
  //column-fill - The column-fill property specifies how to fill columns, balanced or not.
                  values are - balance, auto
                  auto - Fills each column until it reaches the height, and do this until it runs out of content 
                            (so, this value will not necessarily fill all the columns nor fill them evenly)
                  balance - Default value. Fills each column with about the same amount of content, 
                            but will not allow the columns to be taller than the height 
                            (so, columns might be shorter than the height as the browser distributes the content evenly horizontally)
